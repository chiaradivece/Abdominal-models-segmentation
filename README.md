# Abdominal-models-segmentation
The 3D models of the abdominal organs were created from a patientâ€™s anonymized dataset of CT images from DICOM Library (voxel size: 0.59x0.59x0.5 mm, slice thickness: 1.46 mm, image size: 512x126x361). A semi-automatic procedure has been implemented: first, an automatic thresholding method was used to define the anatomical regions of interest, then a manual segmentation was performed to refine the extraction optimally. The available models are the following:
* Aorta
* Arteries and veins
* Bladder
* Colon
* Gallbladder
* Heart
* Inferior vena cava
* Kidneys
* Lateral abdomen
* Linea alba
* Liver
* Pancreas
* Peritoneum
* Portal vein
* Rectus abdominis
* Skin
* Spine
* Spleen
* Stomach
* Subcutaneous fat
* Lower and upper body
